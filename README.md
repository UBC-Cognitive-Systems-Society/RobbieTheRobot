# Robbie The Robot

Simple model of [Robbie The Non-Binary Robot](http://www.cogsubc.ca/exec-team.html), the UBC COGS Mascot

Includes an fbx of Robbie, as well as prefabs for use in Unity projects, and a very simple character controller. The project defaults to an animated face with Unity UI, if you want to use this outside of Unity make sure to grab [RobbieFace-NotAnimated.psd](link tbd)

Robbie is rigged with [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com), so he should be compatible with any animations from there. Note that since he has some extra bones, you need to first upload the fbx in order to have animations rigged correctly.

The project uses skyboxes from [Fantasy Skyboxes by Render Knight](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/fantasy-skybox-18216) and Robbie's antenna is designed with [Dynamic Bone by Will Hong](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743) in mind.
